Given an array of distinct integers, print all the subsets of the given array in lexicographical order.

Input Format

Line 1: Integer T - Number of Test Cases.
Each Test Case has follolwing lines:
Test Case Line 1: Integer N - Number of elements in array.
Test Case Line 2: N space separated integers representing array elements.

Constraints

1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 10
0 <= A[i] <= 100

Output Format

For each test case, print all the subsets of given array one-per line (space separated elements).
Between two test cases output, give an empty line.

Explanation:
1. It's a very good problem for bitwise operation.
2. also this one uses custom comparator function to sort list of lists.

from the below pic we can visualize this:

arra elem:                               2, 3, 1
i (from 1 to 2^(array length i.e.3)) i:  0  0  1
                                     i:  0  1  0
                                     i:  0  1  1
                                     i:  1  0  0
                                     i:  1  0  1
                                     i:  1  1  0
                                     i:  1  1  1
                                     
From the above table its clear that we can create the subset arrays from each iteration of i, wherever the bit is set we will take that array 
element e.g. [1], [3], [3,1], [2] etc.

And use the sort method to sort the input array and the custom sort method to sort the result list of lists.
